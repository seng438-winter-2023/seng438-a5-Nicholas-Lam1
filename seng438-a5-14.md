# Introduction
This lab includes analysis of integration test data using reliability assessment tools. There are two ways to assess failure data:

1. Reliability growth testing
2. Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC)

For both of above parts of this lab, we have utilized SRTAT to generate required outputs of this assignment.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
As mentioned in the introduction portion of this assignment, we have utlizied SRTAT to generate required outputs. For this portion, we have chose to use provided "Failure Report 10.docx" and after converting its data to a text file and by importing to SRTAT and using Littlewood and Varral's Bayesian Reliability model plus Trend Analysis, Below outputs got generated:
Prediction:

and the Trend with 15 iterations is (failure numbers 14~28):
