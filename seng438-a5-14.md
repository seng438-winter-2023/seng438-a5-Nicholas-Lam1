# Introduction
This lab includes analysis of integration test data using reliability assessment tools. There are two ways to assess failure data:

Reliability growth testing
Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC)

For both of above parts of this lab, we have utilized SRTAT to generate required outputs of this assignment.
